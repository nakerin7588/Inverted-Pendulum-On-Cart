# Inverted-Pendulum-On-Cart
This final project is in FRA333(Kinematics of Robotics System) This project exprain process of Inverted-Pendulum-On-Cart. By using simulation from PyGame.

Key components of the project include:
- **Modeling**: Dynamics model of the cart-pendulum system.
- **Controller**: Implementation of PID controller to keep the pendulum stabilize in upright position.
- **Simulation**: A simulation environment to visualize the movement of the cart and pendulum and evaluate the performance of the controller.
